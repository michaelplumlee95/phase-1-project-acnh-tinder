// Animal Crossing New Horizons Villager API
 
What I want my project to do:

I want to implement a tinder-esque card based like/dislike system for picking animal crossing villagers that you would like on your island.

Core features:
    Simple cards showing the Villager's photo, name, personality, birthday, species, and gender.
    A like and a dislike button.
        on like: add character to a list of desired villagers
        on dislike: add character to list of undesirables
    Access to a list of desirable villagers
    Access to a list of undesirable villagers
    Ability to choose 10 villagers to add from your desirable list.
    
Animations:
    onHover, tilt card to the right for hovering over the like button
    onHover, tilt card to the left for hovering over dislike button
    onClick, send card off-screen to the right for choosing like
    onClick, send card offscreen to the left for choosing dislike
