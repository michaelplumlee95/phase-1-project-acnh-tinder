// Animal Crossing New Horizons Villager API

What I want my project to do:

I want to implement a tinder-esque card based like/dislike system for picking animal crossing villagers that you would like on your island.

Core features:
Simple cards showing the Villager's photo, name, personality, birthday, species, and gender.
A like and a dislike button.
on like: add character to a list of desired villagers
Access to a list of desirable villagers
Animations:
onHover, tilt card to the right for hovering over the like button
onHover, tilt card to the left for hovering over dislike button
onClick, send card off-screen to the right for choosing like
onClick, send card offscreen to the left for choosing dislike
\

route 1: Random with fetch requests
route 2: index entire stack

Patch Request: show all liked villagers, send them a message / write a note

Next steps:

Use document.createElement to create a list of liked villagers, put a button on the page somewhere that can do this

Add in the ability to 'send a message' by using a patch request to the message property of the villager object in db.json.
